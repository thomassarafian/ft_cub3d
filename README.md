<h4>Goals</h4>


This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc. <br>

As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.<br>

To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. <br>

With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms
